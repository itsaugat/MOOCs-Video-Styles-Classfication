# MOOCs-Video-Styles-Classfication

Different video production styles, such as, talking head, presentation slides, code/tutorial/demonstration etc. that are used in MOOCs 
platforms are classified using several deep models pre-trained in ImageNet dataset. The concept of Transfer Learning is adopted to leverage
the pre-trained networks by extracting the features from the convolutional base of the model and training a new classifier on top of it.

Comparison results for different pre-trained networks is shown:
 - VGG16
 - VGG19
 - InceptionV3
 - Xception
 - ResNet50
 
 Dataset is avaiable [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/saugataryl/moocs-video-styles).
